A tiny project to train myself in flutter and dart.



## How it works

The app is composed of 3 pages:

- The home page, where you can see the list of your tasks, from here you can add a new task by clicking on the footer button, and the task page is accessed by clicking on a task. you can also delete a task by clicking on the delete button on the right of the task.

</p>

- The add task page, where you can add a new task is composed of 2 field with a submit button. the keyboard display change regard of the inputs.

- The task page, where you can see the details of a task, you can increment or decrement the number of repetitions of your task and save it.
the counter accelerate after 2sec to make it easy to increment high numbers of repetitions.
